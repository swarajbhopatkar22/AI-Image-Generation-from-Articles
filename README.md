# AI-Image-Generation-from-Articles

Project Overview  
This project uses AI to generate high-quality images based on three articles. The task was to understand each article’s content and create realistic images that represent the key themes visually.

Articles and Image Samples:-

Article 1: Global Energy Transition  
- Scenes: Flooded coastal villages affected by rising seas, and politicians debating climate policies at COP summits.

Article 2: Youth Activism and Protests  
- Scenes: Crowds of young protesters in cities holding banners, and youth livestreaming protests at night with police presence.

Article 3: AI Revolution and Image Generation  
- Scenes: A creative working on AI art on a laptop, and AI tools used in everyday life like marketing and education.

1. Install the required libraries:  
```bash  
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate safetensors torch  
```
2. Use the provided Python code with Stable Diffusion to generate images from text prompts.  
3. Generated images are saved in the environment (e.g., Google Colab's file system) and can be viewed or downloaded.
